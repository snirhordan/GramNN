 * @brief Generate the k-vectors (also called reciprocal or Fourier vectors)
 *        needed for the k-space implementation of LODE and SOAP.
 *        More specifically, these are all points of a (reciprocal space)
 *        lattice that lie within a ball of a specified cutoff radius.

/** Function for finding and storing all reciprocal space vectors
 * of a lattice whose length is smaller than a cutoff.
 * INPUTS
 * - basisvecs[3][3]: 3x3 matrix containing the three basis
 *   vectors b1, b2, b3 of a 3D lattice, stored in the format
 *   b1 = basisvecs[0], b2=basisvecs[1] etc.
 *   a general vector in the lattice will then be of the form
 *   k = n1*b1 + n2*b2 + n3*b3, where n1,n2,n3 are integers
 * - kcut: length of the cutoff
 *
 * OUTPUTS
 * Computes half of the lattice points k excluding the origin lying in
 * a ball of radius kcut, where pairs related by k1 = -k2 are only included
 * once. Mathematically, these are the vectors s.t. norm(k) <= kcut.
 * More specifically, all k-vectors within the ball are selected which are
 * lying in the b1-direction from the plane spanned by b2 and b3.
 *
 * DESCRIPTION OF ALGORITHM
 * Essentially, we find the vectors by performing a brute force search of
 * all vectors contained in a box. The first part of the code is used to
 * determine the optimal geometry of this box, while the second part loops
 * over all vectors within the box.
 *
 * The key idea is that a k-vector is parametrized by three integers via
 * k = n1*b1 + n2*b2 + n3*b3. Using these integers, and the Einstein summation
 * convention, we can write the squared norm of k as:
 * k*k = M_ij n_i n_j, where M_ij is the 3x3 matrix M_ij = b_i * b_j.
 * The rest of the algorithm is performed directly in this index-space, i.e.
 * the space of (n1, n2, n3).
 *
 * In the brute force part, we would then like to loop over all possible
 * values of (n1, n2, n3), where 0<n1<n1max, |n2|<n2max and |n3|<n3max
 * to ensure that only half of the points are found (+ some corrections
 * along the boundary n1=0, as described below before the loop starts) for
 * some n1max, n2max and n3max.
 *
 * The preparation part is used to determine the values of njmax that are
 * optimal, i.e. contains the smallest amount of redundancy. We can calculate
 * this analytically in the following way:
 * To get the bounds for n1, fix the value of n1 and consider the restriction
 * of the bilinear form M_ij n_i n_j onto the subspace spanned by (n2, n3).
 * The equation k*k = M_ij n_i n_j can then be recast into the form:
 * k*k + (constant part depending on n1) = quadratic form in (n2, n3).
 * For a solution to exist, the left hand side of this equation has to be
 * positive, which provides us with an inequality that results in a bound
 * for n1, namely n1max. Similarly, we obtain n2max and n3max.
