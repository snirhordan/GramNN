 *        needed for the k-space implementation of LODE and SOAP.
 *        More specifically, these are all points of a (reciprocal space)
 *        lattice that lie within a ball of a specified cutoff radius.

     * two vectors k and -k together. Thus, only one out of each such pair
     * is returned as a representant.

       *     a1 = basisvectors[0], a2=basisvectors[1], etc.
