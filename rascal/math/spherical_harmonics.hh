     * Compute a full set of spherical harmonics (optimized version)
     *
     * Follows the algorithm described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1748
     * except for an additonal \f$(-1)^m\f$ factor to follow the wikipedia
     * article convention
     * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics#Real_form.
     * It effectively cancels out the Condon-Shortley phase in the final
     * real spherical harmonics.
     *
     * In brief, this class computes the real spherical harmonics where the
     * imaginary components of the usual complex functions are instead stored
     * in the negative-m indices:
     *
     * \f{equation}{
     * Y_\ell^m(\theta, \phi) =
     * \begin{cases}
     * \sqrt{\frac{2\ell + 1}{2\pi} \frac{(\ell + m)!}{(\ell - m)!}}
     *     P_\ell^{-m}(\cos\theta) (-1)^m \sin(-m\phi) & \text{for } m < 0\\
     * \sqrt{\frac{2\ell + 1}{4\pi}} P_\ell(\cos\theta) & \text{for } m = 0\\
     * \sqrt{\frac{2\ell + 1}{2\pi} \frac{(\ell - m)!}{(\ell + m)!}}
     *      P_\ell^{m}(\cos\theta) (-1)^m \cos(m\phi) & \text{for } m > 0
     * \end{cases}
     * \f}
     * Note that \f$P_\ell^{m}\f$ includes the Condon-Shortley phase.
     * In case you're wondering why it's \f$\frac{1}{2π}\f$ on the \f$m \neq
     * 0\f$ components (instead of \f$\frac{1}{4π}\f$), there's an extra factor
     * of 1/2 that comes from integrating cos² or sin² over the full circle of
     * φ, so these are indeed normalized in the same sense as the complex
     * spherical harmonics:
     * \f[
     * \iint_{\mathcal{S}^2} dΩ\; Y_\ell^m(θ, \phi) Y_{\ell'}^{m'}(θ, \phi)
     *      = δ_{\ell\ell'}δ_{mm'}
     * \f]
     *
     * (this extra factor of \f$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\f$ is not included in the
     * normalization of the associated Legendre polynomials defined above;
     * however, all other normalization factors are.)
     *
     * The class can also compute \f$(Y^m_l)^*\f$, with the real and imaginary
     * parts of the complex conjugate are stored in a real-valued vector
     * following the same convention.
     *
     * Cartesian gradients can optionally be computed in addition.
     *
     * Part of the efficiency derives from moving the direction-independent
     * calculations into a separate precompute() method; you must therefore call
     * precompute() (which also sets \f$\ell_\text{max}\f$) before any call to
     * calc().
     *
     * Once calc() has been called for a direction vector, the results can be
     * retrieved with get_harmonics() (and the gradients, if computed, with
     * get_harmonics_derivatives())
     *
     * Note the storage order of the harmonics components here follows the
     * "compressed" format, with the \f$\ell\f$ index varying the slowest, from
     * 0 to \f$\ell_\text{max}\f$, and \f$m\f$ varying from \f$-\ell\f$ to
     * \f$\ell\f$ for each value of \f$\ell\f$, for a total of
     * \f$(\ell_\text{max}+1)^2\f$ components.  For example, the first few
     * entries of the array would have the \f$(\ell, m)\f$ numbers: (0,0) (1,-1)
     * (1,0) (1, 1) (2, -2)....
