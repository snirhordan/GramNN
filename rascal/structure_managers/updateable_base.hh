  /**
   * Base class providing/defining the interface of an updatable object.
   * Adaptors, StructureManagers and ManagerSpecies are,
   * for instance updatable, objects since the underlying atomic structure
   * can change, e.g. along a MD run, with its 'neighbour list'.
   *
   * Updatable objects are linked together to form a tree with a root, some
   * branches and some number of leaves. Here is an illustration of such
   * structure:
   *                        ROOT
   *               /                  \
   *          brancheA1              brancheB1
   *            /    \                      \
   *    brancheA11 brancheA12              brancheB11
   *      /   \        /   \                /
   *  leave1 leave2 leave3 leave4        leave5
   *
   * The update mechanism allows to triger an update from
   * anywhere in the tree that will send the update signal to the root which
   * will in turn update itself and the whole tree.
   * The sending of the upward signal to the root is handled with the update
   * function implemented in each class inheriting Udatable. Since this
   * function involves the templated parent structure manager and that it is
   * itself templated it can't be defined explicitly in Updatable.
   * So this class mainly handles the parent to child relationship while
   * the child to parent relashionship is implementated in the classes
   * inheriting from Udatable.
